Android TV Plugin for Cordova
==============================

Cordova plugin to add tags to the AndroidManifest.xml that'll let your Cordova app run on Google TV, Android TV and OUYA.

That's all it does (I just needed something to streamline this process for me).

If you want to interact with the controls on an Android TV or Google TV device just set events on the arrow keys like you would with a desktop web app.

Install
-------

`cordova plugin add https://github.com/comrat/Cordova-Android-TV-Plugin.git`
